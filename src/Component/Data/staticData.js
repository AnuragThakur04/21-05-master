            Cupping is a therapeutic modality in TCM which involving the application of placing a
vacuumized suction cup onto the body surface. Cups placed on the skin are secured by
suction, lifting the skin and underlying muscles, can either be left in a stationary position
or moved back and forth along the body by the practitioner if necessary.

Circular suction marks often be left on the skin after treatment. These marks are the
unwanted toxins that have been drawn, such as static blood, lymph drainage, and
pathogenic factors. Depending on the condition, the marks can range in colour from light
pink to bright red, and even dark purple. The marks will dissipate on their own in about a
week or so, depending on individual body constitution. The skin may also feel tender
immediately after the treatment, but this will usually end after a day or two. Cupping may
look intimidating at first, but the sensation is akin to a deep tissue massage—most
patient’s feedback.

Cupping has gained its popularity for sport-related or pain management and widely used
by athletes for post-training recovery and other sports-related issues.
